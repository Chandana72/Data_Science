# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression

## 📌 Objective  
Predict the survival of Titanic passengers using **Logistic Regression**.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Dataset:** Titanic Dataset  
- **Features:**  
   - Passenger Class  
   - Sex  
   - Age  
   - Siblings/Spouses Aboard  
   - Parents/Children Aboard  
   - Fare  

## 🧠 Techniques Used  
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values using imputation  
   - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., Gender)  
   - Scaled numerical features  

- **Logistic Regression:**  
   - Trained the model using training data  
   - Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  

- **Model Deployment:**  
   - Deployed using **Streamlit**  
   - Created a user-friendly interface for predictions  

## 🔍 Analysis and Interpretation  
- **Significant Features:**  
   - Passenger Class, Sex, and Fare were highly correlated with survival  
   - ROC Curve showed a balanced trade-off between sensitivity and specificity  

## 🚀 Results  
- **Accuracy:** Achieved high classification accuracy  
- **ROC-AUC:** Good separation between positive and negative classes  
- **Insights:**  
   - Female passengers had higher survival probability  
   - Higher passenger class was associated with better survival chances  
- **Streamlit Display:**  
   - Results, including survival probability and performance metrics, are displayed directly on the Streamlit app  
   - ROC Curve and feature importance are also visualized in the app
