# ðŸŒ² Random Forest Classifier

## ðŸ“Œ Objective  
Use the **Random Forest** model for classification on the Glass dataset, including **EDA, preprocessing, and ensemble learning techniques**.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  
- **File:** `glass.xlsx`  
- **Description:** Features representing different properties of glass samples.

## ðŸ§  Methods  
- **EDA:** Identified missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
- **Data Visualization:** Used histograms, box plots, and pair plots to analyze feature distributions and correlations.
- **Preprocessing:** Managed missing values, applied encoding for categorical variables, and performed feature scaling.
- **Random Forest Model:** Trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Bagging & Boosting:** Compared performance of ensemble techniques and discussed their differences.

## ðŸš€ Results  
- Random Forest provided strong classification performance.
- Bagging and Boosting were analyzed for improvements in accuracy.
