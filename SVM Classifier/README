# 🔎 Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier

## 📌 Objective  
Classify mushrooms as **edible or poisonous** using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier.

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Dataset:** Mushroom Dataset  
- **Features:**  
   - Cap Shape  
   - Cap Color  
   - Gill Size  
   - Gill Color  
   - Stalk Shape  
   - Odor  
   - Habitat  

## 🧠 Techniques Used  
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Encoded categorical variables  
   - Split data into training and testing sets  

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**  
   - Trained model using different kernel types (Linear, Polynomial, RBF)  
   - Evaluated model performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**  

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
   - Optimized SVM parameters to improve classification results  

## 🔍 Analysis and Interpretation  
- **Best Performing Kernel:** Identified the most suitable SVM kernel for the dataset  
- **Feature Importance:** Analyzed which features contributed most to classification  

## 🚀 Results  
- **Accuracy:** Achieved high classification performance  
- **Insights:**  
   - Certain mushroom features were strong indicators of edibility  
   - Proper preprocessing improved model accuracy
