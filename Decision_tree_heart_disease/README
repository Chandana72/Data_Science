# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Tree

## 📌 Objective  
Apply **Decision Tree Classification** to predict heart disease based on patient data.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Dataset:** Heart Disease Dataset  
- **Features:**  
   - Age  
   - Sex  
   - Blood Pressure  
   - Cholesterol Level  
   - ECG Results  
   - Maximum Heart Rate  
   - Exercise-Induced Angina  

## 🧠 Techniques Used  
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Removed outliers  
   - Encoded categorical variables using **Label Encoding** and **One-Hot Encoding**  

- **Decision Tree Classification:**  
   - Split data into training and testing sets (80-20)  
   - Used `Gini` and `Entropy` criteria for node splitting  
   - Tuned hyperparameters (max depth, min samples split, criterion)  
   - Visualized tree structure to identify important features  

## 🔍 Analysis and Interpretation  
- **Key Hyperparameters:**  
   - `max_depth` – Limits tree size to prevent overfitting  
   - `min_samples_split` – Minimum samples needed for a node to split  
   - `criterion` – `Gini` or `Entropy` for calculating splits  

- **Encoding:**  
   - **Label Encoding** – Assigns a unique value to each category (suitable for ordinal data)  
   - **One-Hot Encoding** – Creates separate binary columns for each category (useful for nominal data)  

## 🚀 Results  
- **Accuracy:** Achieved high accuracy on testing data  
- **Insights:**  
   - Age, cholesterol level, and exercise-induced angina were the most influential features  
   - Balanced trade-off between overfitting and generalization through hyperparameter tuning
