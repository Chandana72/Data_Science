# 📊 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) & Clustering

## 📌 Objective  
Perform **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and apply clustering algorithms to both original and PCA-transformed datasets to evaluate their effectiveness.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Dataset:** `wine.csv`  
- **Description:** The dataset consists of multiple features representing different characteristics of wine samples.

## 🧠 Techniques Used  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Loaded the dataset and examined feature distributions  
   - Used histograms, box plots, and density plots for visualization  
   - Analyzed correlations between features  

- **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:**  
   - Standardized the features to ensure a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1  
   - Applied **PCA** to reduce dimensionality  
   - Determined optimal principal components using scree plots & explained variance  
   - Transformed the dataset into principal components  

- **Clustering with Original Data:**  
   - Applied **K-Means Clustering** to the original dataset  
   - Visualized clustering results  
   - Evaluated clustering performance using **silhouette score** and **Davies–Bouldin index**  

- **Clustering with PCA Data:**  
   - Applied **K-Means Clustering** to PCA-transformed data  
   - Visualized clustering results  
   - Compared clustering performance with original dataset clustering  

## 🔍 Analysis and Interpretation  
- **Comparison of Clustering Results:**  
   - Evaluated clustering differences between original and PCA-transformed data  
   - Assessed the impact of dimensionality reduction on clustering quality  
   - Analyzed trade-offs between PCA and direct clustering  

## 🚀 Results  
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA effectively reduced dimensions while retaining variance  
- **Clustering Performance:** Analyzed the differences in clustering effectiveness  
- **Key Insights:**  
   - PCA helps reduce noise and redundancy in high-dimensional data  
   - Clustering on PCA-transformed data can sometimes improve or alter group separability
